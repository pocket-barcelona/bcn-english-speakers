## Contents

## Recommendations

The location you choose will very much depend on where you plan to meet in Barcelona, but here are our top picks (in no particular order).

---

### 1. Federal Cafè Gòtic

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, lunch or co-working, daytime.'
  address={'Ptge. de la Pau, 11, 08002 Barcelona'}
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/vpvr1odh7dQ8FrHc7'
>

Federal Cafe is hidden in the Gothic neighbourhood, so you'll want to get out the map if you don't know the area. It can get busy, especially during lunchtime, but it's a great place to have a coffee, some food and a casual meeting.

A lot of people also tend to use it as a temporary office space as there's Wi-Fi. Also check out their spaces in Sant Antoni (C/ del Parlament, 39, 08015 Barcelona) and Poble Nou (Carrer del Taulat, 109, 08005 Barcelona).

</ListingBlock>

### 2. Soho House Barcelona

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Pre-booked client meeting or co-working, mainly daytime.'
  address='Pl. del Duc de Medinaceli, 4, 08002 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/NYNejjFU59CCZFVJ9'
>
Being a more exclusive, upmarket option that requires a membership, Soho House might not be suitable if you're looking for a simple place to just turn up on the day. But if you plan ahead, it will be a great choice. There's a Soho House in Garraf, too, right on the beach, just in case you're in that area or Sitges close by.

### 5. L'Actiu Restaurant
This restaurant is not one you'd naturally stumble upon unless you live or work in the area, but it doesn't disappoint. Their lunch atmosphere is excellent and usually full of local workers having quick two-course meals before heading back to the office. To date, they still do a menu del día, so be sure to check it out any day of the week.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client lunch, daytime.'
  address='C/ de la Llacuna, 162, 08018 Barcelona'

### 6. JOK
JOK is a very high-class restaurant with a beautiful private terrace at the back. You have to make a reservation and it is open in the day and evening. If you're trying to impress or want privacy, we highly recommend this place. Also, their cocktails are great, so it's a nice spot for a date, too.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='High-end client coffee or drinks (patio), exquisite lunch or dinner (restaurant), cocktails or drinks (bar area), daytime or evening.'
  address='C/ de Mallorca, 275, Entresol, C/ de Mallorca, 275, Entresuelo, 08008 Barcelona'

### 8. OneCoWork
OneCoWork has more than one location, all of which have modern office facilities, such as video conferencing, phone boots, sofas/hammocks and beautifully designed interior decor. You can book out a meeting room in advance, but be sure to contact them ahead of time to check availability.

</ListingBlock>


### 9. La Esquina

La Esquina offers a very relaxing and sophisticated atmosphere where you can enjoy a great coffee at a comfortable table. Given that it is so centrally located, you'd expect it to be very busy, but it is also next door to a Starbucks. If you're looking for a space next to Plaza Cataluña, this could be a great choice.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, cakes and pastries, small lunch, daytime.'
  address="C/ de Bergara, 2, 08002 Barcelona"
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/b2sLtkfha98y6zGcA'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 10. Cafe Libro Born
Cafe Libro in Born is a quaint little coffee shop tucked away off C/ de la Princesa offering a relaxing environment for a quiet chat and good coffee. It's not huge, but if you're in the area, it could be a nice spot for a short client meeting.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Quiet, sleek client coffee, cakes, daytime.'
  address='Carrer de la Barra de Ferro, 1, 08003 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/8GuiwvcRZSVL4QX99'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 11. Alice Secret Garden
Coming from the busy street of Pau Claris, you don't expect a huge outdoor terrace garden area to be hidden away here. Alice Secret Garden is a great choice if you want to just impress someone over drinks/cocktails, but you can also use it for casual meetings, first dates, afterwork drinks –– you name it! No booking is required, which makes it handy if you're just passing by.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee on terrace or in bar area, drinks or cocktails, daytime or evening.'
  address='C/ de Pau Claris, 90, 08010 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/5QQe2Ste3GEV3pbS7'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 12. Itnig Café (Syra Coffee)
Itnig is a nice place and always quite lively yet still relaxing, fitting in well with the semi-laid-back vibe you find in Poblenou. Their coffee is awesome and you should also sample their fine array of cakes and pastries –– the coffee shop itself seems to be a front-end for the ever-popular Syra coffee chain. Lots of people hang out there using it as a makeshift co-working space. 

Note: Avoid busy lunch times as there can be a queue.
<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, casual meeting.'
  address='C. de Pujades, 100, Sant Martí, 08005 Barcelona'
  map='https://maps.app.goo.gl/F9fTbgaJJDFp1qEV6'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 13. Nomad Coffee - Lab & Shop
Nomad Coffee has been around for a while and it couldn't be in a nicer setting (Passatge Sert, in El Born). Being quality purveyors of coffee, you'll be sure to get an exquisite cup of coffee and you won't be left short trying their range of beans. As for meeting a client, it's a little on the small side but is often quiet during the day.
<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, casual meeting.'
  address='Passatge Sert, 12, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona'
  map='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WzFYztuDLuQFTxda6'

### 14. Camelia Art Café
If you find yourself up near Sagrada Familia, this one might be for you. The coffee is consistently excellent and the cakes are also exquisite –– not to mention the fairytale interior decor. It's not the biggest space in the world, but it's a hidden gem for those who don't know it yet. Recommended for casual client coffees and the like.
<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee and cakes, daytime.'
  address='C/ de Padilla, 264, 08025 Barcelona'

### 15. Satan's Coffee Corner
Most need GPS to find this place, but if you make it to the front door, you're on to a winner! It's only a small coffee shop, but they go all-out when brewing you a decent coffee and you'll be happy you paid them a visit. It would be a great option for a casual client chat, provided you find a space to sit!
<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, daytime.'
  address="C/ de l'Arc de Sant Ramon del Call, 11, 08002 Barcelona"
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/vgV9PGLxnkkomvfP9'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 16. Apocapoc BCN
Also in Poblenou, Apocapoc offers a coffee shop and co-working space. It's usually fairly busy but if you time your visit right, you should get a table.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, daytime.'
  address="Nest City Lab, C. d'Àlaba, 100, 08018 Barcelona"

### 17. Honest Greens
Honest Greens have multiple locations in Barcelona and both mentioned below don't disappoint. Be mindful to time your visit, as it's usually heaving at brunch and lunch peak times. However, they have a dedicated coffee service point so you can fast-track the queues if you're not eating. For a casual client chat over coffee, these can certainly be great options. Also, in the summer towards the late afternoon, it's nice to visit the new Barceloneta location, which has a terrace right next to the beach. 

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, brunch and lunches, daytime.'

### 18. Bar Central Raval
The name doesn't really do this place justice, as once you get there, you'll be impressed to see such an elegant coffee shop on an otherwise busy street in the heart of El Raval. The entrance these days is through the bookshop to the right and they also have a rear patio terrace, which many people don't realise. Their coffee and cakes are excellent and you'll find yourself going back.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee and cakes, daytime.'
  address="C/ d'Elisabets, 6, 08001 Barcelona"
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/CYWKpMovgqytiqCC6'

</ListingBlock>


### 19. La Plaça Gourmet Cafeteria
Most people know this place as “the cafe on the top floor of El Corte Inglés”, which boasts great views over Plaça de Catalunya. The cafe is huge, so you won't have difficulty finding a table. It's not the most formal place for a client meeting but couldn't get any more central, so if you want a casual chat over coffee, it does the job!

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee and cakes, breakfasts and other meals, daytime.'
  address='Pl. de Catalunya, 14, 08002 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/xXDgt8dn1jr5X78d8'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 20. NIMURA RAIMA Rooftop
Raima is actually an art supply store, so you wouldn't think to go there for a drink - but if you trek to the top floor, you'll find a neat little terrace where you can enjoy a quiet coffee or beer in style. Considering it's also very centrally located, it's ideal for a casual coffee with a client or a visiting friend. 

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee or beers, daytime.'
  address='C/ Comtal, 27 Ático, 08002 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/Bb3nhhUMkdFc5cwb7'

</ListingBlock>



### 21. La Lluna
La Lluna is a gem in the Gothic neighbourhood. If you're after elegant local Catalan cuisine done right, then this is for you. Their menú del día is still available (as it has been for years), and while the prices are above average, it's worth the extra few euros to dine in such elegance. It's only open during the day, so we highly recommend it for client lunches. Just be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointment.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client lunches, daytime.'
  address='C/ de Santa Anna, 20, 08002 Barcelona'

### 22. Flax&Kale
Be sure to check out their other restaurant in El Born, but this one on C/dels Tallers has a nice rooftop terrace that's perfect for healthy drinks, brunch, coffee and more. You may need to book ahead if you want a specific table, but you can also just walk in. The proximity to Plaça Universitat makes it an ideal choice if you've just flown in and you're not sure where to go!

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, brunches and other meals, daytime.'
  address='C/ dels Tallers, 74b, 08001 Barcelona'

</ListingBlock>


### 23. BENZiNA
Tucked away just off one of Sant Antoni's trendiest streets, you'll find these two huge restaurants/bars. Both are ideal for enjoying a fancy client lunch/dinner or a casual drink. Terrace space is also available, but it can get rather busy towards the evening, especially in the summer.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client lunches, daytime and evening.'
  address='Passatge de Pere Calders, 6, 08015 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/s8wQwadP3zHKRjeY8'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 24. Vivant
Vivant is a studio with a restaurant on the side in the heart of Eixample. It's a stylish place, so if you're out to impress, you could get extra credit for picking out this one.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Either a client lunch or just a casual drink or coffee.'
  address='C/ del Consell de Cent, 394, 08009 Barcelona'
  map='https://goo.gl/maps/Eg6fXhJXbBuYLkPJA'
>
</ListingBlock>


### 25. Laie Llibreria Café
Hidden upstairs in Laie Llibreria bookshop, you will find a nice little coffee shop with seating and table service. It offers good respite from the busy Eixample neighbourhood and the atmosphere inside is chilled. Also, it has Wi-Fi, so you'll see people using it as a coworking space, too.

<ListingBlock
  recommendation='Client coffee, daytime or late afternoon casual meeting.'
  address="C/ de Pau Claris, 85, L'Eixample, 08010 Barcelona"
