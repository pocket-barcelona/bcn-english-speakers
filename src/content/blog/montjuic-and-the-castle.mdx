## About the castle

![Montjuïc Castle panorama](../../assets/blog/15-montjuic-castle/the-castle/montjuic-castle-panorama.jpg)

Montjuïc Castle is a great place to go with the family for a short day trip in Barcelona, even if you don’t pay to go in. The view from the castle and surrounding walls offers stunning near-360 degree panoramas. On a clear day, you’ll feel like you are on top of the world, with an excellent view of Barcelona and the sea. How you approach the castle and Montjuïc in general is up to you, but <a href="#how-to-get-to-the-castle-of-montjuïc">below are our recommended options</a>.

### Inside the castle

When you enter the castle, you’ll come to the reception area where you can buy tickets. As of 2024, the entrance is €5 per person (with discounts available for over 65s, families, etc, so ask inside for terms).

As well as granting you access to the castle itself and the highest viewpoints, there are a number of exhibition rooms with a lot of interesting historical content (available in several languages), and you can walk freely around the castle grounds.

### The view from the castle

The Castle of Montjuïc offers stunning views out over the sea and equally great vistas of the city. For the best experience, it’s necessary to pay the entrance fee (which is relatively cheap), as you’ll get the best views from the castle walls. You can also walk around the top.

If you don’t have time to enter the castle, you’ll still get some breathtaking views out over the sea just by walking around the perimeter of the castle walls. There’s also some great walking to be done in this part of Montjuïc.

## How to get to the Castle of Montjuïc

Many tourists choose to take the cable car to Montjuïc. Keep in mind that **there are two cable cars** and they are not connected at all. This can often confuse a lot of people!

### Tourist Route 1: Both Cable Cars

Take the ‘teleférico’ (cable car) from Barceloneta, which departs from the [Aeri station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cYT884MU3T5zfWA67). The cable car will drop you off about halfway up Montjuïc, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5w8gFUj5P3YZPD8VA) at Plaça de l'Armada and the Gardens (Jardins del Mirador Montjuïc).

  { url: "/src/assets/blog/15-montjuic-castle/routes/route-1/piscina-mirador-montjuic.jpg", alt: "View from the Montjuïc swimming pool" }
]}></Gallery>


From here, it’s a [15 to 20 minute walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5euGQPcwqwcm1s5p7) up the road. Don’t miss the [Mirador de Montjuïc](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Soy4Fyw6Qg5VQdfcA) and the [Mirador de Poble Sec](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HFituTy3oZWe7zadA) too, as well as the [Mirador Swimming Pool](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U89pcr41EQrBX6HM9) (*subject to the swimming pool or the cafe being open in summer/autumn*).

Across the road from the swimming pool, you will see the second cable car station, which is also next door to the funicular station. Take this cable car to the top of Montjuïc, which drops you off right next to the castle.

- **Summary**: Barceloneta -> 1st Cable Car -> Walk 15 mins -> 2nd Cable Car -> Castle
- **Approx. Price**: Around €30
- **Price breakdown (as of 2024)**:
  - Cable Car 1: €12.50 one-way trip.
  - Cable Car 2: €16 round trip.
  - (optional): Funicular back down to Paral·lel metro station

<div class="warning">

<strong>Tip</strong>: You can also get the Montjuïc Funicular from Paral·lel metro station to Montjuïc, if you just want to do the second cable car only –– see route 2 below.

</div>

---

### Tourist Route 2: Funicular + Cable Car

A shorter tourist route would be to take the funicular from Paral·lel metro station (T-Casual tickets can be used) to the top, then simply connect with the [Montjuïc Cable Car](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rtMj8PTtozYCcF7h7). This is literally next door to the funicular station, so there’s no uphill walking involved.

- **Approx. Price**: About €18.40
- **Price breakdown (as of 2024)**:

<div class="success">

<strong>Tip</strong>: Be sure to check out the view from the [Montjuïc swimming pool](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wF7HaLsR2mV87XNXA) before you jump on the cable car.

</div>

### Route 3: Walk - Plaça d'Espanya, Palau Nacional + Cable Car

Begin at [Plaça d'Espanya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QqjjXbx59KCs8fxY6) or [Palau Nacional](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7s1nWxaCkmf5CxfP7) (National Palace) and take the walking route round to the left of the National Palace, which eventually takes you to the Montjuïc Cable Car. Then take the cable car to the top, or walk through the beautiful park and woodland instead.

</div>


## Additional Routes

### By bus

The [150 bus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YuhHRdd8zQPVvVec8) route serves Montjuïc and leaves from Plaça d’Espanya. Take the bus from here and it’ll drop you close to the castle, requiring only a very short walk to the entrance. The bus is, of course, included in the T-Casual (or equivalent) ticket.


### On foot

It is possible (and recommended) to walk up to the castle from Poblé Sec, Plaça d’Espanya, La Bordeta or Drassanes/Las Ramblas, all of which are popular starting points for most people.

There are several routes from the Poble Sec neighbourhood, all of which include different points of interest along the way. Here are our favourites, but all can be adapted as needed.

In all cases, when walking back down to Barcelona, you can take pretty much any route down, where all roads lead to home!

Continue heading up to Avinguda Miramar, where you will be able to get a great view over Poble Sec from the municipal swimming pool.

Crossing the road, continue on through the gardens of Joan Brossa, which eventually leads you up to Ctra. de Montjuïc and the Castle, passing under the cable car as you walk through the gardens.

Walking up from Plaça del Sortidor in Poble Sec, you very soon arrive at the Greek Theatre - you should spend 30 minutes here taking in the nature and unique space, but also to visit the ampitheatre.

Moving on, walk up the road and through the [Jardins de Laribal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8k4TKMMtvQTt5TvJA) and up past the [Joan Miró Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gHNsSMM9yTEL7egK7).

Following the road up, head into the Gardens of Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer (be sure to explore them first), then head towards the Ctra. de Montjuïc, which passes you next to the halfway cable car station. Finally, ascend to the Castle.

## What’s nearby the Castle?

During the warmer months, the castle plays host to open-air concerts and gigs inside the castle itself. We highly recommend checking one out, as the venue is very unique. Between June and August, there’s also [Sala Montjuïc](https://www.salamontjuic.org), an open-air cinema. The cinema takes place in the grassy area (Fossat de Santa Eulàlia), and they usually kick-off the night with a live band before the film starts.

![Sala Montjuic](../../assets/blog/15-montjuic-castle/sala-montjuic.jpg)

The same lawn is the setting for archery classes, provided by the [Club Arc Montjuïc](https://www.arcmontjuic.cat/).

The castle also hosts musical events, which are well worth looking into as it’s an amazing setting for live music.

The intrepid few who don’t mind the walk will enjoy a trip to the [Mirador del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tGRySSPcjmMakqEj9) and the hidden bar of [La Caseta del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wcXqg1cpQTb1zmXb7), which in the summer hosts chilled DJ sessions if you’re lucky enough to catch them.

Just down the hill from the castle to the north, there’s also the amazing [Jardins del Mirador](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W23ETLygRhFgQpY39), which is a beautiful garden also with sea views.

In addition to all the above, you can find more information and events via the official Barcelona Ajuntament (council) Montjuïc page [here](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/castelldemontjuic/en).
