## Michael Collins (La Sagrada Familia)

The Michael Collins is worth the trip up to the Sagrada Familia neighbourhood. While it’s not super central, you’ll find that it still gets busy most nights and they play host to live music, mostly on the weekends. One thing we like about this pub is that it also attracts the locals, so you will find a mixed clientele. If you’re planning to visit Sagrada Familia, then it’s worth popping in for a pint. We recommend the fish & chips, but come with an empty stomach!

Address: Plaça Sagrada Família, 4, 08013 Barcelona

## The George Payne Irish Pub (Dreta de l'Eixample)

The George Payne Irish Pub is the go-to location for people wanting to watch the football. Being in the centre of Barcelona, it is a more busy and serious establishment, usually playing residence to large groups, stag and hen parties and generally hardcore drinkers. The George Payne is usually busiest during sporting events, so avoid these if you just want a quiet pint!

Address: Pl. Urquinaona, 5, 08010 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/9PGoTa29j7GKHfxp8 


## The James Joyce (Dreta de l'Eixample)
The James Joyce is the last stop on your pub crawl when going out in that direction from the centre towards The Michael Collins. There’s often a laid-back atmosphere and it even has a few seats outside, which are often available, even at night. It may not be the most famous Irish pub in Barcelona, but it never fails.

Address: C/ de Casp, 92, 08010 Barcelona

## Dunne’s Irish Bar and Restaurant (El Gótico)
Another well-located Irish bar (and in my opinion very underrated) is Dunne’s on Via Laietana. It usually plays refuge to those visiting El Gótico and El Born areas and The Cathedral. The clientele is varied and it can be anything from empty to packed, depending on the time of day and local events. They also play major sporting events, such as the football, on one of their many screens.

Address: Via Laietana, 19, 08003 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/c8bfyTbtWTgRDD8HA 


## Flaherty’s Irish Pub (El Gótico)
Flaherty’s is another secluded pub and is lesser known since it is located in a quiet square just off the Las Ramblas main strip. You will find all the pub classics, from Irish breakfasts to fish & chips and pies, not to mention a decent pint of Guinness!

Address: Plaça de Joaquim Xirau, s/n, 08002 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/y8DXtdzKqcLPEYXK6 


## Travellers Nest Bar (El Gótico)
Nested in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, you will find the Travellers Nest. It has been around for years, but in recent times has fallen below par (in our opinion) –– but it still gets a mention in our exhaustive list! One saving grace is that it is open relatively late and could be a quieter option if you’re in the area but not wanting to go to a club. At the time of writing, they were serving food, including breakfasts, but it’s nothing to write home about.

Address: C/ de la Boqueria, 27, 08002 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/vSzfDB4ugK16p72j8 


## The Old Irish Pub (Ramblas)
The Old Irish Pub on Las Ramblas is a solid boozer usually with serious drinking going on –– mainly tourists –– and has a large inside space. It usually has a good drink selection, food available and even live music on some nights (check the Old Irish Pub Barcelona website for events). If you’re looking for straight-up drinking action, then this place is for you.

Address: Rambla dels Caputxins, 31, 08001 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/4e1kbi7Txd45r3bMA 


## Bloomsday Irish Pub (Ramblas)
The Bloomsday, in contrast to the Old Irish Pub just up the road, is a bit more chilled out, although things can change in peak tourist season and at the weekends. The inside decor also feels familiar and similar to that of the Michael Collins pub up at Sagrada Familia. Not the cheapest pub out of them all, due to the fact that it’s on Las Ramblas, but it will certainly keep you hydrated if you pay a visit!

Address: La Rambla, 21, 08002 Barcelona

## Irish Pub Temple Bar, My Bar & Lennox The Pub (Ramblas)
Here we have three pubs, all within a stone’s throw of one another, situated near Plaça Reial on Carrer de Ferran. While being close, they are all very different –– My Bar is the smallest and the other two are larger. The clientele are usually tourists, again due to the proximity to La Rambla.

Temple Bar Address: C/ de Ferran, 6, 08002 Barcelona

## Cheers (Ramblas)
<div class="warning">Awaiting recommendations.</div>

Address: C/ de la Boqueria, 15, 08002 Barcelona

## WILD ROVER (Ramblas)

Just a stones’ throw away from the bottom of Las Ramblas, you’ll find the Wild Rover tucked away. Presumably connected to the popular Wild Rover hostels, which you can find all over the world, this pub is a straight up Irish pub with a sleek interior, complete with ‘match watching facilities’. If you need a break from the busyness of La Rambla, it’s worth popping down.

Address: C. de Sta. Mónica, 2, Ciutat Vella, 08001 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/M8xJaFRHRjX2kmnw8 


## McCarthy’s Bar (El Born, Via Laietana)
McCarthy’s is a bit smaller than others in the area, but it still packs a punch on major sporting nights due to its intimate atmosphere. The space itself is a narrow but long pub and the seats at the back can be a strategic place to hide out if you can get there early enough. Also, the bar staff like a bit of banter and are pretty friendly (much like most Irish pubs), and it’s good that you can get a decent pint so close to the centre.

Address: Via Laietana, 44, 08003 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/HnK1LWDtRZPaTyaG7 


## The Bullman (Sant Antoni)
Also popular for its pub quiz (Wednesdays, though check beforehand) you will be able to get a solid pint and pub grub at The Bullman. The menu isn’t very extensive in our experience, but it’s not a huge pub anyway. The location can certainly be handy if you happen to be in El Raval/Sant Antoni, so if you’re hopping from place to place, consider including it on your route.

Address: C/ de Muntaner, 1, 08011 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/FvjCP8SF2qFVct339 


## The Shamrock (El Raval)
For the Raval area, The Shamrock is up there with the best. The ambiance and clientele are more in line with what you expect from a decent Irish pub, and there’s never a boring moment. Plus, it’s been there for years, so it’s well-established. During the day and evening, you can sit on their terrace and, of course, they do pub food, too.

Address: C/ dels Tallers, 72, 08001 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/E8UdKmW5tY5R2cba6 


## Obama (Rambla de Catalunya)
<div class="warning">Awaiting recommendations.</div>

Address: Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 603, 08007 Barcelona

## Scobies Irish Pub (near Pl. Catalunya)
With Scobies, you already begin to notice that you’re no longer in the Barcelona Old Town and instead you’ve ventured into the Eixample neighbourhood. It’s worth a visit if you want a bit of a break from shopping, and this pub is often unknown to a lot of expats in our experience. Still, the Guinness is solid.

Address: Ronda de la Univ., 8, 08007 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/KpqgxDwiyNSmFUD47 


## The Black Horse (El Born)
One of the great selling points of this pub is the cool, laid-back terrace where you can enjoy a casual pint in the heart of the El Born neighbourhood. The clientele can be a bit mixed and you’ll probably be among tourists while there, but it’s still worth a visit if you’re in the area. As far as we know, they don’t tend to show major sporting events, but legend has it they put on a pub quiz every Sunday, if that’s your thing.

Address: C/ de l'Allada-Vermell, 16, 08003 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/ppoBsbVzrMh9Wni98 


## Lennox The Pub - Palau (El Born)
The Lennox gets extra points for being well-situated for those doing walking tours of Barcelona’s Old Town and El Born in particular. The outdoor terrace can be fairly handy, and it is usually table service outside. On the flip side, sometimes the traffic can be bothersome if a quiet pint is what you’re after, but the somewhat dark inside will more than do the job. It can sometimes get a bit touristy and they’re not well-known for food, but with Honest Greens and several other decent restaurants just a stone’s throw away, this shouldn’t be a problem.

Address: Pla de Palau, 9, 08003 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/G1jEehkhbtaSdyPr7 


## The Fastnet Pub (Barceloneta)
Being in Barceloneta, The Fastnet is generally more popular with tourists. It offers a relaxed pub atmosphere, which can be a nice contrast to the other bars and restaurants in the area, as most are tapas, fish, and grill places. Having said that, in the summer you’ll find it very lively yet chilled out at the same time. Speaking English will go a long way in this pub and you’ll immediately feel at home!

Address: Pg. de Joan de Borbó, 22, 08003 Barcelona

Map: https://maps.app.goo.gl/PNi7yoaA6WJQFBv1A 


## Green Room (Poblenou)
The Rambla of Poblenou wouldn’t be complete without an Irish bar! They do most of the pub classics, such as fish & chips, and most of the time it’s table service, which you don’t always get at the other Irish pubs. They also have a large terrace, so if you’re lucky enough to get a seat, you’ll be able to watch the world go by. It’s a tad more expensive than the others, but still generally affordable. If you’ve just come back from a hard day at Bogatell beach and you’re walking down the Rambla of Poblenou, be sure to check it out.

Address: Rambla del Poblenou, 20, 08005 Barcelona

## The City Tavern (f.k.a. Beer City Irish Pub) (Gràcia)
This is a personal favourite and one of the best places to watch the football sat down in comfort. Not so many know about this tavern, probably due to it being so far from the centre. But for locals, it’s still easily within reach since it’s just a short walk from Diagonal metro. You’ll want to book a table beforehand if football’s what you intend to see and once you get there, it’s usually food and drink with table service.

Address: Plaça de Narcís Oller, 9, 08006 Barcelona
