## What is a Cal√ßotada?

A cal√ßotada is a Catalan tradition where people get together and eat cal√ßots. If you live in Catalunya and you‚Äôve not heard of a cal√ßot, then it‚Äôs possible that you have not yet completed your Catalan onboarding!

The cal√ßot season gets into full swing during the winter months, between about December to early March. The idea is to enjoy this very Catalan tradition with a large group of friends in a rustic restaurant, usually in the countryside, where you will eat cal√ßots, bread, and char-grilled meats, such as butifarra, morcilla, chicken and a selection of grilled beef or lamb cuts.

That being said, the main focus is usually on the cal√ßots, which are best accompanied by a special romesco sauce, which is made with toasted almonds or other nuts, roasted red peppers, garlic, and other tasty ingredients.

**Cal√ßots are a type of green onion** that look like big spring onions or small leeks - but are indeed a different variety in their own right. They are grown using a special method, where soil is used to cover the bulbous part of the onion as it grows, forcing the vegetable to sprout up and giving the cal√ßot its unique appearance and ultimately its flavour.

When it comes to cal√ßotadas, you‚Äôll probably want to find a restaurant that does all the cooking and prep for you. But it‚Äôs true that a lot of locals cook their own on the fire at one of the popular outdoor BBQ spots near Barcelona or around Catalunya.


**Below you will find a list of some of our favourite places to eat cal√ßots!**

## Cal√ßots - cook your own, near to Barcelona

There are a few places where you can cook your own calcots near to Barcelona, but we have chosen our 2 favourite spots, which are both relatively close to Barcelona and accessible by public transport.

### **Cal√ßots @ Font de Les Planes**, Les Planes. [üîó Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fontdelesplanes/)

![Font Les Planes](../../assets/blog/32-calcots/les-planes.jpg)

#### How to get there

##### By public transport

- Take the train (S1 or S2 train, not the metro) from Pla√ßa de Catalunya to Les Planes station direct (20 mins, T-Casual zone 1 works, since Les Planes is the last station in zone 1).
- From the train station, walk over the bridge and down the road to the restaurant (5 mins walk).


##### By car

We‚Äôll leave the directions up to you, but there is a car park. Just don‚Äôt arrive too late or you might struggle to get a space!


This place has fixed BBQs and tables for diners who are using the BBQs outside, with the metal cooking grill available to hire. You can also buy BBQ coal and wood (no booking, but first come, first served). These are available at the booth when you check-in. Note: BBQ coal is approximately ‚Ç¨5 a bag (updated 2023) and the firewood is a fair price too, but you can only pay with cash (no cards!). You will also need to pay a cash deposit for the metal grill rental. Also important to note is that you will need to take everything else, such as all the food you‚Äôre going to eat, all cooking equipment, plates, drinks, etc.

<div class="warning">

There is also a large restaurant at the venue, but it‚Äôs recommended to make a booking by phone in advance.

### **Cal√ßots @ Europa Barbacoa**, Gav√†. [üîó Website](https://www.europabarbacoa.es/)

![Europa Barbacoa](../../assets/blog/32-calcots/europa-bbq-field.jpg)

Europa Barbacoa is a very popular spot where you can go and cook your own cal√ßots (or whatever else you like) on the many BBQs provided.


#### How to get there

##### By public transport

Example route from Pla√ßa de Catalunya: [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GArNPkcKVtA3s8WTA)
- Take the L95 bus from Rda. Universitat - Pla√ßa Catalunya to Av. Europa - Vandell√≤s (T-Casual ticket, zone 1 valid).
- The bus passes by Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya, so you can also jump on at any stop along the route.
- The journey time is about 45 minutes and the bus stops right outside the entrance to the space.

##### By car

By car, it‚Äôs about a 30-minute drive (from central Barcelona).

<div class="warning">

**Note**: You can hire chairs, which are usually ‚Ç¨1 each, and tables for ‚Ç¨4. Coal and firewood are available if you don‚Äôt want to bring your own. There‚Äôs also a big restaurant on the site, separate from the BBQ area, but the main attraction is the BBQ field. Surrounded by trees, it‚Äôs a nice spot with lots of space and you can just set up with a group wherever you like, with the BBQ area in the middle.

_And finally, some other popular places to eat cal√ßots in 2024..._


### Cal√ßots @ Cava Jaume Gir√≥ i Gir√≥

Similar to Europa Barbacoa, this is a DIY BBQ place where you can host your own cal√ßotada. But as the name suggests, it‚Äôs also a winery, located in the ‚Äòcava town‚Äô of Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia (which is also home to the famous Freixenet winery). 

The BBQ spot is on a pretty, family- and dog-friendly patio and costs ‚Ç¨13 per person, which includes not just rental and coal or firewood but a bottle of the winery‚Äôs own natural cava or wine. You can buy more bottles from the shop and there‚Äôs a bar for those wanting other drinks. 

#### How to get there


##### By public transport

Take the R4 ([Rodalies](https://rodalies.gencat.cat/es/inici/)) train from Pla√ßa de Catalunya, Sants or another central station to Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia. It takes about an hour. You‚Äôll then need to walk through the town (which is very picturesque) for about 10 minutes. 

##### By car

By car, it‚Äôs about a 50-minute drive (from central Barcelona).

### Cal√ßots @ Can Coll (Collserola)

You will find Restaurant Can Coll nestled deep in the Collserola National Park north of Barcelona. It is best accessed by car, such as from the nearby Cerdanyola del Vall√®s. Nevertheless, they have lots of grills for you to cook cal√ßots or general BBQ food.

Be sure to pay a visit to **Castell de Burriac** if you‚Äôre in the area. It requires a fair amount of uphill walking, but it‚Äôs well worth the visit!
