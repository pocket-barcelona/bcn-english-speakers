## About Barcelona neighbourhoods

Quite often, when you move to a new city, you do not know where the best place to live is. In Barcelona especially, you have many neighbourhoods to decide between, all with their own character and perks. It depends a lot on what your personal circumstances are when it comes to choosing the right place to live.

The city is divided into 10 districts, each with its own distinct personality and attractions. Here is a brief overview of some of the most popular neighbourhoods of Barcelona:

## Where to live in Barcelona?
It depends on what you enjoy and what you are used to, but I will give my view of the locations as places to live. 

If you are visiting the city, you will want to stay in the Ciutat Vella region as it is in the heart of the city and close to most tourist attractions.

Below are the pros and cons of each neighbourhood from the experiences and views of people I know.

---

### Ciutat Vella

#### El Raval

This is the edgy part of the city centre – it’s a mixing pot of all ethnicities and well located for most things.

<div class="success">

**Pro’s:** Great location, cheap property for the location, good variety of ethnic stores.

</div>
<div class="danger">

**Con’s:** Higher levels of crime, older buildings, very noisy most of the time, risk of okupas (squatters).

</div>



#### El Gótico

Another central neighbourhood inside what was the old city. Being right in the heart of Barcelona, it is a maze of narrow medieval streets.


<div class="success">

**Pro’s:** As central location-wise as you will find for the city, lots to see, do and explore and close to all the shops and attractions, close to the marina (Port Vell).

</div>
<div class="danger">

**Con’s:** Lots of active pickpockets, packed with tourists, buildings can be old and lower floors have very limited light, noisy.

</div>



#### El Born

The trendy central neighbourhood. More light and space than Gótico and closer to the park and beach, if that’s your thing. Lots of attractions, but with that comes lots of people.

<div class="success">

**Pro’s:** Location location location. It’s right in the centre but close to the beach and park. Lots of restaurants and bars.

</div>
<div class="danger">

**Con’s:** Packed most of the time with drunk tourists, some properties on a low level will hardly see any light, problems with petty crime, a couple of dodgy areas in the centre of the barrio.

### L'Eixample

The central residential district of Barcelona, Eixample has an easy-to-navigate grid system and is close enough to the city to feel well connected.


<div class="success">

**Pro’s:** A good location for the city centre and a quieter vibe than Ciutat Vella. Lots of good public transport options and close enough to all the attractions if you are visiting. Safe, and offers some quieter streets and blocks with a more community-focused vibe.

</div>
<div class="danger">

**Con’s:** Further away from the beach if you enjoy this, high prices as an in-demand neighbourhood. Can be noisy if you are on one of the main roads that cross the city (Gran Via/Aragon).
