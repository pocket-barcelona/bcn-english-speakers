## How to be a freelancer in Barcelona, Spain

Being a freelancer (autonomo) can be a big and difficult decision for people living in Spain, because it can be hard to compare and contrast the pro's and con's when compared with being employed by a company.
To make it more complicated, the law in Spain has changed in the last few years and so self-employed people have different benefits than in previous years.

## How to become autonomo officially

The process of becoming autonomo in Spain is relatively straightforward, but the best way would be to hire a 'gestor' (accountant) as they will know the legal and clerical steps and documents that need submitting, and when. Below is an outline of what you can expect in your first year.

	⁠Note: This is for people who:
	⁠Have not been autonomo before, or;
	⁠Have been autonomo before, but not in the last 3 years

The first step is to register yourself as "alta" in the records of the social security


## How to become autonomo again, if you've been autonomo before

If you decide to become autonomo again you could be in one of two boxes:
 1.⁠ ⁠If at least 3 years have elapsed since the time you registered as "baja" at the hacienda, or;
 2.⁠ ⁠If you are becoming autonomo again within 3 years of being "baja".

If you fall into category 1, above, then the social security contributions that you will pay will be *as if you had started out as autonomo from fresh*. That is, you will pay the introductory contributions every month, according to [this table](www.link.com).

If you fall into category 2, above, then you will pay full contributions, according to [this table](www.link.com).

Hi Jordan,

As promised, here's the requirements that I followed:

- Professional bank account (allow some time to set this up as they'll need to go into the bank and sign documents etc, but the pre-requisite is to already be "alta" as "autonomo" (freelance) in Spain. Or indeed be a LTD company, "S/L. in Spanish")
- Invoicing - La Fosse raises an invoice on my behalf through the InTime app. Note that VAT (or IVA in Spanish) isn't charged due to the reciprocal agreement between countries.
- Professional Indemnity insurance & Liability insurance - see attached policy of mine - page 3 will be useful as it gives the overview. Also, here's the 2 insurances in more details (convert the webpage to English!). Note: I went with Hiscox and it's renewed annually

https://www.hiscox.es/seguros/responsabilidad-civil-profesional
Seguro de Responsabilidad Civil Profesional - covers my business activity
(Equivalent to the Professional Indemnity insurance in UK)

https://www.hiscox.es/seguros/responsabilidad-civil-general
Seguro de Responsabilidad General Profesional - covers general liability
(Equivalent to the Liability insurance in UK)

Let me know if I missed something or you need more info.


Kind regards,
Darryl
