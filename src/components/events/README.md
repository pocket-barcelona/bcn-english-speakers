# TO-DO's

1. Handle events which are in the past.
   1. Disable attend button
   2. Hide from events list? Should the backend do this?
2. ✅ Handle location hidden events (hide address, map etc. Write location hidden on the QR step?)
3. ✅ Disable QR code if step not required
4. ✅ Submit actual RSVP
5. Handle bad RSVP submission cases - full, waiting list, ticket type not available? Bad event data - name, last name?
6. Event data - redact hosts array, promo codes, rsvps list
